# CFG-Python-Edamam-Api
Hi all.
This is an Edamam API recipe search project, created for Code First: Girls

The recipe search allows you to look up recipes based on ingredient, meal type and diet input. A recipe ingredient list is printed out and saved to a text file if needed. The program allows the user to enter another option for ingredient, meal type and diet (can loop through the options until chosen to stop).

The program will also allow the user to review the calories of the saved recipe and will sort them in descending values.
